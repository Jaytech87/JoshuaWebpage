          <p>Hello, I am Joshua Lytle, a military vet, proud father, uncle, brother, and a mentor. I have recently been motivated to seek a change in careers from and Industrial Maintenace Technician to a Full Stack Developer I'm also currently in the Army Reserves. I have been in the military for 14 years years. The everyday life of being a technician has ran its course and I feel the need to find a career that will challege me and provide professional growth. I chose the Full Stack Developer path because of its challeges and rewards. Live by motto, The work you put in, will be greatly rewarded. Once I enter into enter into the field of developer I will hopefully be able to introduce more people to the field and help others to be proficient as a developer.</p>
